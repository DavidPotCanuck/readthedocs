****************
Hosted TCGA Data 
****************

All TCGA *metadata* is considered open-access.  In other words, information *about* controlled-access data 
files is open-access.  Metadata can be obtained programmatically using the ISB-CGC programmatic API.

An overview of the TCGA data currently hosted on the ISB-CGC platform is provided in the two sections below.
The first section breaks the data down by access class (open *vs* controlled), and the second section breaks
it down by original source repository (DCC *and* CGHub).
