Investigator(s) requesting and receiving Genome - Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data in accordance with the `NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy <https://gds.nih.gov/>`_
are expected to:

* Submit a description of the proposed research project; 
* Submit a **data access request (DAR)**; the DAR requires NIH log-in. 

**Note:** Requesters and institutional SOs must have an NIH eRA User ID and password to access the DAR. Visit electronic Research Administration (eRA) <http://era.nih.gov>`_
for more information on registering for a NIH eRA account. NIH staff may utilize their NIH log-in. (See additional instructions at `Data Access Request Instructions <http://www.genome.gov/20019654>`_); 

Additionally, they must:
 
*  Submit a `Data Use Certification (DUC) <http://www.genome.gov/20019653>`_ co-signed by the designated Institutional Official(s) at their sponsoring institution; 
*  Protect data confidentiality (Any data used in a study which was initially listed as "Controlled" or TCGA remains as controlled data and **MUST** be protected accordingly, unless prior authorization is obtained from NCI data custodian); 
*  Ensure that data security measures are in place (**Only project members authorized to receive controlled data should be listed in a project using controlled data** for example: **Project 1**- has only users authorized to access Controlled data and a DUC in place; **Project 2** - has only open access users, **NO** Controlled Data Access Allowed);
    - **Remember** â€“ you and your institution are accountable for ensuring the security of this data (see `NIH Security Best Practices for Controlled-Access Data <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/GetPdf.cgi?document_name=dbgap_2b_security_procedures.pdf>`_)
*  Notify the appropriate Data Access Committee of policy violations; and 
*  Submit annual progress reports detailing significant research findings. See more at: `Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) <http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-07-088.html#sthash.Hde6DhfF.Fbj4vpAj.dpuf>`_.
