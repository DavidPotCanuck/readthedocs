Data Use Certification (DUC)

Investigator(s) requesting and receiving Genomic data in accordance with the `NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy <https://gds.nih.gov/>`_
are expected to:

* Submit a description of the proposed research project; 
* Submit a **data access request (DAR)**; the DAR requires NIH log-in. 

**Note:** Requesters and institutional SOs must have an NIH eRA User ID and password to access the DAR. Visit `electronic Research Administration (eRA) <http://era.nih.gov>`_ for more information on registering for a NIH eRA account. NIH staff may utilize their NIH log-in. (See additional instructions at `Data Access Request Instructions <http://www.genome.gov/20019654>`_) dbGap Data Access `Request Portal <http://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&page=login>`_; 

Additionally, they must:
 
*  Submit a `Data Use Certification (DUC) <http://www.genome.gov/20019653>`_ co-signed by the designated Institutional Official(s) at their sponsoring institution. Sample `DUC form <http://gds.nih.gov/pdf/Model_DUC.pdf>`_;
*  Protect data confidentiality (Any data used in a study which was initially listed as "Controlled" or TCGA remains as controlled data and **MUST** be protected accordingly, unless prior release authorization is obtained from NCI data custodian); 
*  Ensure that data security measures are in place (**Only project members authorized to receive controlled data should be listed in a project using controlled data** for example: 
    **Project 1**- has only users authorized to access Controlled data and a DUC in place;

    **Project 2** - has only open access users, **NO Controlled Data Access** Allowed from/by Project 2 member(s));

**Remember** â€“ YOU and YOUR Institution **are accountable** for ensuring the security of this data, not the cloud service provider (see `NIH Security Best Practices for Controlled-Access Data <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/GetPdf.cgi?document_name=dbgap_2b_security_procedures.pdf>`_) 
    - The Investigator and their associated institution assume the responsibility for the security of the dbGaP data.  As such, NIH has tried to provide as much information as possible for PIs, institutional signing officials (SOs) and the IT staff who will be supporting these projects, to make sure they understand their responsibilities. (Ref: The `Cloud, dbGaP and the NIH blog <http://datascience.nih.gov/blog/cloud>`_ post 03.27.2015)

Finally, they must:

*  Notify the appropriate Data Access Committee of policy violations; and 
*  Submit annual progress reports detailing significant research findings. See more at: `Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) <http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-07-088.html#sthash.Hde6DhfF.Fbj4vpAj.dpuf>`_.
