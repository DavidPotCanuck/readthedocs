TCGA Data in BigQuery
######################

The information scattered over tens of thousands of XML and TSV files at the DCC is provided in a *much more accessible* form in
a series of BigQuery tables.  For more details, including tutorials and code examples in 
`Python <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python>`_ or 
`R <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-R>`_, please see our `github repositories <https://github.com/isb-cgc>`_.

This `introductory tutorial <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python/blob/master/notebooks/The%20ISB-CGC%20open-access%20TCGA%20tables%20in%20BigQuery.ipynb>`_
gives a great overview of all of the tables and pointers on how to get started exploring them.  Be sure to check it out!
