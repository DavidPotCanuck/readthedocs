******************
Cloud-Hosted Data 
******************

The ISB-CGC platform hosts a variety of types of data using different Google Cloud technologies:

* The higher-level, open-access data is available as a series of standardized, curated BigQuery tables.
* The original data files (as uploaded from the original source repositories) are available in Google Cloud Storage.

Further more some of the data is "open-access" while other data is "controlled-access".  All "metadata" 
(*ie* data about the data) is considered open-access.

The sections below describe data available from different Google Cloud technologies:
