**********************************************
ISB-CGC Cloud Credit Available for Researchers
**********************************************

To facilitate us and evaluation of the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC) Pilot, NCI is providing credits to researchers to use on our systems within the Google Cloud Platform.

The table below shows the four available user spending tiers.

+-------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Tier  | Amount             | Description                                                                                                                                             | Requirements                                                                                              |
+=======+====================+=========================================================================================================================================================+===========================================================================================================+
| **1** | $300               | Given by Google as a 60-day "free trial" credit upon registration as a new Google Cloud Platform user                                                   | We will encourage but not require people to use the Google credit first                                   |
+-------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **2** | $1,000             | Available after initial new user credit has been depleted                                                                                               | Provide feedback as requested by ISB-CGC leaders                                                          |
+-------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **3** | Up to $10,000      | Available after tier 2 credit has been depleted to begin a large or collaborative project (two or more researchers working on a project together)       | Provide project details such as scientific goals, support requirements, collaboration details, etc.       |
+-------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **4** | More than $10,000  | Available ISB-CGC leaders believe users have made good use of depleted credit and can provide a reasonable justification for needing additional credit  | ISB-CGC leaders will need to present a case on behalf of researchers and obtain NCI's approval            |
+-------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Users are also free to fund their own research using the ISB-CGC platform.

For each of the four ISB-CGC credit tiers above, ISB-CGC leaders will coordinate directly with individual researchers to provide access to the platform. For tier 3 projects, the CGC Pilots will also consult with the researchers to provide support and suggest approaches that may expedite and reduce the cost of the project.


**Important Notes**

Since these platforms are pilots, researchers should have no expectation that their data or tools will be maintained after the Cloud Pilots program is completed on September 27, 2017.
If a researcher has used all available ISB-CGC credit and is still storing data on one of the CGC Cloud platforms, it is the researcherâ€™s responsibility to get more credits, arrange for billing, or download any data they wish to keep.
