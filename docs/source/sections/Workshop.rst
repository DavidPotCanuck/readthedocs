Please send an email to info@isb-cgc.org with the following information:

    * your Google identity (*eg* gmail address)
    * are you bringing a Mac or Windows laptop?

Feel free to ask any other questions you might have about the workshops or
give us additional information about your specific use-case or goals for

any additional support you will need.

What you should do before the workshop
######################################
Once we have your Google identity, we will add you as a member to two
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects: a group-project for the workshop,
and a personal project for your own work.  You will then be notified by 
email and additional information will be provided to you at that time.

Here are some ways that you can prepare for the workshops:

    * learn your way around the Google Cloud Console
    * install the Cloud SDK on your laptop
    * create a free account for yourself on GitHub
    * install the GitHub desktop app on your laptop
    * install R and RStudio on your laptop
