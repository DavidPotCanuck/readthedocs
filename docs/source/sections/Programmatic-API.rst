Programmatic Interfaces
=======================

Programmatic access to molecular data in BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, or Google Genomics
is based directly on the interfaces provided by the Google Cloud Platform, as 
illustrated throughout the ISB-CGC code repositories on github_.

In order to query the ISB-CGC metadata or to get information such as details regarding a
cohort that a user may have saved during an interactive session, a series of APIs based 
on Google Cloud Endpoints have been defined.  Details about these APIs as well as instructions
on using helper scripts for the oAuth flow can be found here.
