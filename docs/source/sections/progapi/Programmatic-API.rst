***********************
Programmatic Interfaces
***********************

Programmatic access to molecular data in BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, or Google Genomics
is based directly on the interfaces provided by the Google Cloud Platform, as 
illustrated throughout the 
`ISB-CGC code repositories on github <https://github.com/isb-cgc>`_.

In order to query the ISB-CGC metadata or to get information such as details regarding a
cohort that a user may have saved during an interactive session, a series of APIs based 
on Google Cloud Endpoints have been defined.  Details about these APIs can be found here,
and examples illustrating how to use these endpoints from R and Python can be found in 
our `examples-R <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-R>`_ and
`examples-Python <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python/tree/master/python>`_ repositories.

The Google
`APIs Explorer <https://apis-explorer.appspot.com/apis-explorer/?base=https://api-dot-isb-cgc.appspot.com/_ah/api#p/>`_
can be used to see each API and try it out through your web browser. 
Following that link will show you a list of ISB-CGC APIs. 
Each API typically bundles several functionally-related endpoints together.
Note that not all of these APIs are intended for direct use by end-users: 
some are intended for use only by the ISB-CGC Web-App.
In order to see the individual endpoints within a single API, click on the API name,
such as the `cohort API <https://apis-explorer.appspot.com/apis-explorer/?base=https://api-dot-isb-cgc.appspot.com/_ah/api#p/cohort_api/v1/>`_.

Cohorts are the primary organizing principle for subsetting and working with the TCGA data.
A cohort is a list of samples and a list of patients.  (TCGA samples are identified using a
16-character "barcode" *eg* ``TCGA-B9-7268-01A``, 
while patients are identified using the 12-character prefix (*eg* ``TCGA-B9-7268``) of the sample barcode.
Other datasets such as CCLE may use other less standardized naming conventions).  Users may
create and share cohorts using the ISB-CGC web-app and then programmatically access these cohorts
using this API.


**Authorization**

Some, but not all, of the endpoints require authorization.  This authorization is not related to
controlled-access data: these endpoints do not operate on or directly return any controlled data.
Instead, authorization is related to saving or retrieving cohorts because cohorts are *private* to 
the user who creates a cohort (and anyone the cohort owner chooses to share the cohort with).
Helper scripts, described below, are provided to access these endpoints from the command line.

**Note:** Prior to using any endpoints that require authorization, a user must have signed into the
`web application <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/>`_ at least once.

Step 1: User runs::

   $ python isb_auth.py

Script `source <https://github.com/isb-cgc/ISB-CGC-Webapp/blob/master/scripts/isb_auth.py>`_.

This starts an oauth flow, opening a browser tab and asking the user to log in with their google email address. Once authenticated, the userâ€™s information, including access and refresh tokens, are written to their root directory in a file named ``.isb_credentials``. A ``--verbose`` flag displays the location and name of the file as well as the access and refresh tokens.

If a user is running this script via ssh, the ``--noauth_local_webserver`` flag will allow the user to obtain a verification code through their local browser.

Step 2: Once the credentials file is stored on the user's home directory, they can access any API requiring authentication with the command::

   $ python isb_curl.py {ENDPOINT_URL}

Script `source <https://github.com/isb-cgc/ISB-CGC-Webapp/blob/master/scripts/isb_curl.py>`_.


The Cohort API currently bundles several different cohort-related endpoints:
