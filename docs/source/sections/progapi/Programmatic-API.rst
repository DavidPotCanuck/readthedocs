Programmatic Interfaces
***********************

Programmatic access to molecular data in BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, or Google Genomics
is based directly on the interfaces provided by the Google Cloud Platform, as 
illustrated throughout the 
`ISB-CGC code repositories on github <https://github.com/isb-cgc>`_.

In order to query the ISB-CGC metadata or to get information such as details regarding a
cohort that a user may have saved during an interactive session, a series of APIs based 
on Google Cloud Endpoints have been defined.  Details about these APIs can be found here,
and examples illustrating how to use these endpoints from Python can be found in 
our `examples-Python <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python>`_ repository.

The Google
`APIs Explorer <https://apis-explorer.appspot.com/apis-explorer/?base=https://api-dot-isb-cgc.appspot.com/_ah/api#p/>`_
can be used to see each API and try it out through your web browser. Each API may bundle several endpoints that are functionally related.

Cohorts are the primary organizing principle for subsetting and working with the TCGA data.
A cohort is a list of samples and a list of patients.  (TCGA samples are identified using a
16-character "barcode", while patients are identified using the 12-character prefix of the sample barcode.
Other datasets such as CCLE may use other less standardized naming conventions).  Users may
create and share cohorts using the ISB-CGC web-app and then programmatically access these cohorts
using this API.


**Authorization**

Some of the endpoints require authorization. Scripts are provided to access these endpoints from the command line.

**Note:** In order for authorization to work properly, the user must have logged into the `web application <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/>`_ at least once.

Step 1: User runs::

   $ python isb_auth.py

Script `source <https://github.com/isb-cgc/ISB-CGC-Webapp/blob/master/scripts/isb_auth.py>`_.

This starts an oauth flow, opening a browser tab and asking the user to log in with their google email address. Once authenticated, the userâ€™s information, including access and refresh tokens, are written to their root directory in a file named ``.isb_credentials``. A ``--verbose`` flag displays the location and name of the file as well as the access and refresh tokens.

If a user is running this script via ssh, the ``--noauth_local_webserver`` flag will allow the user to obtain a verification code through their local browser.

Step 2: Once the credentials file is stored on the user's home directory, they can access any API requiring authentication with the command::

   $ python isb_curl.py {ENDPOINT_URL}

Script `source <https://github.com/isb-cgc/ISB-CGC-Webapp/blob/master/scripts/isb_curl.py>`_.


The Cohort API currently bundles several different cohort-related endpoints:
