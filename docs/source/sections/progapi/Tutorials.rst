For ISB-CGC users who want to write custom scripts in R or Python, 
we have begun to assemble a set of examples in two public github 
repositories: `examples-Python <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python>`_
and `examples-R <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-R>`_

These repositories contain numerous examples that will help you learn 
to access and analyze the TCGA data in BigQuery, as well as examples
showing how to use our APIs to query the metadata and discover where to find the data
that you are looking for in Google Cloud Storage.
