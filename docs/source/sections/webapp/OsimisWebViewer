Radiology images are viewed using the Osimis Web Viewer, a plug-in to the Orthanc image server (Orthanc). The ISB_CGC web application uses an instance of Orthanc to manage radiology files for the purpose of viewing. Currently only DICOM formatted files from TCGA samples are available viewing. It may be helpful to understand the `DICOM Model of the Real World<http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part03.html#chapter_7`
