The ISB-CGC web application functionality is accessed through a Google account identity (freely available `with a new account <https://accounts.google.com/signupwithoutgmail?hl=en>`_ or `by linking to an existing email account <https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail>`_).  If you have not logged into the ISB-CGC application you will be presented with this page:

You login through the "Sign In" link at the upper right of the initial page (label "A" in the image above).  Also on this page are links to our project's overall documentation (including non GUI documentation) (B), our public GitHub repository (C), a link to provide feedback (D), a link to more information about ISB-CGC (E), and our required "Warning Notice" (F) indicating that this is a U.S. Government Sponsored Website and by using it you are accepting the policies associated with its use.

Upon logging in with a Google account identity, you will be presented with the following page:

This is your personal "Dashboard" where all your relevant Analyses, Gene Lists, Variable Lists, Cohorts, Projects (your own data), and Public Datasets are stored and readily accessible.  You can also create new Sample Analyses with various chart types through the Sample Analyses section.  Details of how to use each component are provided in individual subsections of this documentation.

Multiple Sample Analyses can be grouped into Workbooks (and saved for later use, editing, and sharing).  Workbooks are used to group together multiple related analyses, and can be used for sharing groups of analysis results with specific groups of people.  For example, you may have one study involving identifying gene mutations and pathways involved in Head and Neck Cancer (with a given research group) where you keep all the files in one Workbook, and another study with a different group of researchers investigating the average time after diagnosis of death of different lung cancers - stored in another Workbook.  Think of workbooks as virtual "excel spreadsheets" that various related analyses can be created in individual Worksheets and grouped together in one Workbook.

**Breadcrumbs** are displayed to show where you in the Web Interface as you move from one section to another (figure below).  These are live links, and can be used to rapidly navigate from one section of the interface to another.

* General description of panes in the Dashboard
 * Concept of Dashboard to save your work
 * Concept of Workbook to hold multiple Sample Analyses for a given study you are doing (e.g. Pathways and gene mutations seen in Head and Neck Cancer (workbook 1), Determining average age of death from Breast Cancer of each specific subtype (workbook 2)
* How to navigate.  Cookie Crumb interface in upper left to help in navigation
* What data am I working with?  All of TCGA?  Other data (e.g. CCLE)?  Is it the same data as from the non-GUI interfaces? Can I add my own data (link to Upload Project Data documentation)?  If so, can I see it?  Can others see it?  How can I share it for others?
* Is there any way to use the same data in the GUI and the non-GUI UI (e.g. saved cohorts I have made)?  Where can I find how to do that?
* How to get to Help, to other non-GUI documentation
* Written for Google Chrome, likely to work with other browsers but not tested
