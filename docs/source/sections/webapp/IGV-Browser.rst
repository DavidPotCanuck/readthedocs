IGV-Browser
===========

**Important:**  Improved integration of the IGV browser and the ISB-CGC hosted data will be coming soon!  Specifically
the IGV browser will be able to access the *high-level* molecular data in the ISB-CGC BigQuery tables as well 
the *low-level* sequence data via the GA4GH API.

Accessing the IGV Browser
-------------------------

To access the IGV browser, go to the cohort file list page. The file listing table includes a column labelled “IGV”. For
those files that also have a ReadGroupSet ID in Google Genomics, a green check mark will appear in the column. Clicking
on that link will take you to the IGV browser with the appropriate dataset and readgroupset preselected.
