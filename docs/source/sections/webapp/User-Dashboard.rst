User Dashboard
==============

*Documentation in progress!*

Create a Cohort
---------------
To create a cohort from the user dashboard, click on the “+ Create” button and select “New Cohort”. 
This will take you to the cohort creation page.

Create a general visualization
------------------------------
To create a visualization from the user dashboard, click on the “+ Create” button and select “Visualization”. 
This will take you to a new visualization with default settings selected.

Create a SeqPeek visualization
------------------------------
To create a visualization from the user dashboard, click on the “+ Create” button and select “SeqPeek”. 
This will take you to a new SeqPeek visualization with no default settings selected.

Batch operations on cohorts and visualizations
----------------------------------------------
**Delete:** To delete a set of cohorts, first check the boxes next to the cohorts you wish to delete. 
The “Trash” button should become selectable after selecting at least one cohort. Click on the “Trash” 
button to delete the selected cohorts. This is the same for Visualizations

**Share:** To share a set of cohorts, first select the boxes next to the cohorts you wish to share. 
The “Share” button should become selectable after selecting at least one cohort. Click on the “Share” 
button to share the selected cohorts. A dialogue box will appear and prompt you to select the users 
you wish to share with. You will be able to remove cohorts you no longer want to share. You will 
be able to select from a list of users that are already registered in the system and you may select 
one or more users you wish to share with. Click the “Share Cohort” button when you are done. This is 
the same for visualizations. 

Users who you share a cohort with will only be able to view and comment on the cohort and not 
make changes. They will need to clone the cohort before making changes to it.

Set operations on cohorts
-------------------------
To activate the set operations button, you must have at least one cohort selected. Upon clicking 
the “Set Operations” button, a dialogue box will appear. Here you may do the following things:
Enter in a name for the new cohort you’re about to create.
Select a set operation.
Edit cohorts to be used in the operation.

The intersect and union operations can take any number of cohorts and in any order.

The complement operation requires that there be a base cohort, from which the other cohorts will be subtracted from.

Click “Okay” to complete the operation and create the new cohort.

Cohort listing
--------------
When the “Cohorts” tab is selected, the system is displaying all the cohorts that you own and all the 
cohorts that have been shared with you.

Clicking on the name of a cohort in the list will take you to the cohort details and editing page. 

Visualization listing
---------------------
When the “Visualizations” tab is selected, the system is displaying all the visualizations that you own 
and all the visualizations that have been shared with you. 

SeqPeek visualization listing
-----------------------------

When the “SeqPeek” tab is selected, the system is displaying all the SeqPeek visualizations that you own 
and all the SeqPeek visualization that have been shared with you.

Search for cohorts and visualizations
-------------------------------------
To search for cohorts and visualizations by name, you can use the search bar at the top of the page. This 
will produce a results page of two lists; one for cohorts and one for visualizations. This search only 
does a string matching with the names of cohorts and visualizations.

Sorting of cohorts and visualizations
-------------------------------------
You can sort the listing of cohorts and visualizations using the column headers. By clicking on a column, 
it will indicate whether it is sorting that column in ascending order or descending order.
