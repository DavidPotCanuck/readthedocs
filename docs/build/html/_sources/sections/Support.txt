Your Own GCP
############

To request a Google Cloud Project (GCP), please send a request to request-gcp@isb-cgc.org.

In your request, please describe your research goals in some detail, including information such as the type 
of data that you plan to use (whether it is your own data that you plan to upload or
TCGA data currently hosted by the ISB-CGC), the algorithms and/or methods you plan to apply,
and an estimate of the storage and computing costs you expect to incur.
Please let us know if you have students or collaborators who will also be accessing the
same GCP.  Note that if you are working as a team on a single project, you should all
use the same GCP -- if your group is large, we will take this into consideration when
determining your funding level.

If you have previous experience using the Google Cloud Platform, that would be 
useful for us to know -- including which specific components (*eg* Compute Engine, BigQuery,
Cloud Datalab, *etc*).

All reasonable requests will receive an
initial allocation of $300 towards storage and compute costs.  We expect that this
amount of funding will be more than enough for you 
to become familiar with the platform.  If you expect that you will need additional funding 
to complete your planned research, this initial amount should be used to perform prototype
analyses and to better estimate your total costs.  At that time, you may request additional funding.
