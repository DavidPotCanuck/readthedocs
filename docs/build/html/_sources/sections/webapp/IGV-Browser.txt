IGV-Browser
===========

*Documentation in progress!*

The IGV Browser connects to the Google Genomics API. The ISB-CGC Project has both open and protected datasets. If you
are authorized to access protected access datasets, they will appear in the selection options. You must select a dataset,
which will display the related readgroupsets. You can select one or more readgroupsets to display.

Accessing the IGV Browser
-------------------------

To access the IGV browser, go to the cohort file list page. The file listing table includes a column labelled “IGV”. For
those files that also have a ReadGroupSet ID in Google Genomics, a green check mark will appear in the column. Clicking
on that link will take you to the IGV browser with the appropriate dataset and readgroupset preselected.
