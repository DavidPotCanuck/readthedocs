SeqPeek
=======

*Documentation in progress!*

SeqPeek is a visualization designed to show mutations on a protein associated to a Gene. It allows users to select
multiple cohort and view mutations on a single gene across all of those cohorts.

Creating a SeqPeek Visualization
--------------------------------

You can create a new SeqPeek visualization from the user dashboard. Select the “SeqPeek” option from the “+ Create”
menu. This will automatically take you to a SeqPeek page with no settings preselected for you. To make changes, open
the Settings panel.

In the Settings panel, there will be options to select in order to make a new plot.
* Gene selection: This is an autocompleting dropdown that will search the database for valid genes the system has data
for.
* Cohorts: This is where you can select one or more cohorts to plot at one time.

To add a cohort, select the “+ Cohort” option underneath the currently selected list of cohorts. This will take you to
the cohorts listing panel where you can select a cohort from the list, or use the autocomplete textbox to search in
their list of cohorts.
When all the settings have been set, you can click “Update Plot” to regenerate the plot with the new settings.

Saving a SeqPeek Visualization
------------------------------

To save changes to the visualization, click “Save Visualization” button. This will prompt you to name your SeqPeek
visualization and save. You will be notified if it saved correctly or not.


Deleting a SeqPeek Visualization
--------------------------------

**From User Dashboard**

Select the SeqPeek visualizations that you wish to delete using the checkboxes next to the visualization. When one or
more are selected, the delete button will be active and you can then proceed to deleting them.

**From SeqPeek Visualization**

If you are viewing a SeqPeek visualization you created, then you can delete the cohort from the top right menu option.
